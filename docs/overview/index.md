[//]: # The goal of this page is to give a simplified overview of your software. 
[//]: # You can probably pull a lot of this from your manuscript, but you probably do not want to show entire figures. Think about which components of which figures are necessary to give readers an overview of the software, isolate those components, and insert them here?
[//]: # Ideally, this will description will rely on images more than text
[//]: # See [ASHLAR](https://labsyspharm.github.io/ashlar/overview/overview-land.html) for an example of this.

# What's MY SOFTWARE?
1-2 sentence description

# Why?

What was the current need in the field that motivated the development? Start out by setting the scene. End by describing how your software fills this gap.

# How does it work?
The software runs three main steps
>1.  Does this first, 
>2. then uses that to do this next step, 
>3. then finally generates this output
