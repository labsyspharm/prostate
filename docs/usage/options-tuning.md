# Options Tuning

Depending on your software, you may need additional pages for more detailed instructions. For instance, if your software can be highly customized by the user, you may want to provide some examples about how to tune the specific options within the software to generate particular results.

**I recommend including useful links to other content rather than duplicating content.**

>**Ex:**  You can view a complete list of parameters available for MY SOFTWARE [here](./). See the [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](FAQ.html) page for more useful information and common pitfalls.
