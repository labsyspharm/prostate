# Tutorial
[//]: # The goal of the tutorial is for users to make sure that your software works with their system. 
[//]: # Lead them through a simple workflow using a sample data set. The tutorial should not give options it should be a well defined path -- you do X, Y, Z and you get this result. See the [MCMICRO tutorial](https://mcmicro.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) for an example.

**Step 1:** First, [install](usage/installation.html) MY SOFTWARE.

[//]: # If the installation is simple (there's only one way to install), you may prefer to hide the installation page (nav_exclude: true) and embed the installation instructions into this tutorial page

**Step 2:** Descriptive second step. The second step might be obvious to computational folks, but if your software is crossdisciplinary or geared towards users who are *not* computational, you should be explicit.
